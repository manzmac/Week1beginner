					<h1>THE ODD WON OUT</h1>
					<p>"The Odd Won Out" means that you shouldn't always have to try to fit in. You should fully express yourself. Create what you want for yourself and be what you represent! You could be different, the "odd" one out, and still be the winner!</p>
			
					<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
					<p>My name is Manuel Macaraeg.  Born in 92'.  Raised in San Francisco, CA.  All my life I was highly influenced by the 80's/90's Culture.  Moved by the Art of Hip Hop, Graffiti, Cartoons, Dancing, and all types of visuals and sounds that intrigued my eyes and ears.</p>
